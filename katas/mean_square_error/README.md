# Mean square error

### Description
Complete the function that

* accepts two arrays of equal length
* compares the value each member in one array to the corresponding member in the other
* squares the absolute value difference between those two values
* and returns the average of those squared absolute value difference between each member pair.

### Examples
```ruby
mean_square_error([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]) #=> 9
mean_square_error([10, 20, 10, 2], [10, 25, 5, -2]) #=> 16.5
mean_square_error([-1, 0], [0, -1]) #=> 1
```
