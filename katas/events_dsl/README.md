# Events DSL

### Description
This is another kata not from codewars. But still it landed here.

This is first attempt at writing Domain Specific Language in Ruby. It's based on the Paolo Perotta's book `Metaprogramming Ruby 2: Program Like the Ruby Pros`

### Example
Navigate to `katas/events_dsl/lib/` in your terminal. Then run `ruby redflag.rb` to see an output.
