# Hello new meta class

### Description
Part of meta-programming is creating classes dynamically.

In this task you need to make module Foo, such that if you call any inner class of Foo that doesn't exist, Foo will create the inner class and return a friendly greeting to the new class.

### Examples
```ruby
> Foo::Bar
=> "Hello, Bar!"

> Foo::Lemon
=> "Hello, Lemon!"
```
